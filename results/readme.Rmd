-   `maps` contains all maps created in ArcGIS. It would be good to reproduce these but it's probably not necessary. Note that these don;t contain any of the new 2019-2022 data.

-   `output` contains the SLR .rds files

-   `presentations` contains old posters/presentation slides.

-   `reports` contains old written reports.

-   `tables` contains the SLR results as a png, produced by the `table-gen.R` script. Other model results can be saved in a similar way.
