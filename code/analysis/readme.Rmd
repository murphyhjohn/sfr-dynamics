-   `model-fits.R` is a script that fits all models (SLR plus some others that I think are better for our data). Models should be compared and a best should be selected, but I haven't done that yet.

-   `table-gen.R` is a script that generates a table of the SLR results. The code will work with other model fits objects in the `model-fits.R` script.
