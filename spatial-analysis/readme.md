# spatial-analysis

-   `spatial-lag` contains all files I had saved from the spatial lag regression model I fit. The reliability of these files is minimal :). This should be run with the new processed data in the `data` folder.

-   Hot/Cold spot analysis files were too large to be added to GitHub. They should be rerun anyways with the new data. You should just need the processed data in the `data` folder and a shapefile of US counties and ArcGIS Hotspo Analysis does the rest.
